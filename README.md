For my dissertation I aim to develop a prototype of an eAssesment system with focus on marking automation in order to research how technology can improve the efficiency of the exam marking process. I was able to identify some of the possible requirements for such a system, however I won't be able to develop all of them in the time window.. I need to identify how useful they are in relation to each other to help me prioritise which features should appear in the prototype.
